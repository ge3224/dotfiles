# This is an example configuration file for the required listing of Ansible playbook hosts.
#
# To use this configuration file:
# 1. Make a copy of this file and rename it to `inventory.yml`.
# 2. Update the values in the `inventory.yml` file as needed with your actual hosts.
#
# Note:
# - The `inventory.yml` file should not be committed to version control (e.g., git) to keep sensitive information secure.
# - Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes `inventory.yml` to prevent accidental commits.
